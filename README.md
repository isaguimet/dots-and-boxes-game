# SENG513-dots-and-boxes

In this game, the objective is to be the player with the most completed boxes by adding lines to the board game canvas.

### How do you play?

Players take turns to add lines to the board. Each player can add one line of their color to a grey dashed line that connects 2 adjacent dots. Whenever a player completes a box, the box will be colored to the player's color and count one point towards the player's total box count.

Players who complete a box, get one extra turn (they get to add another bonus line).

The game ends when someone claims the last box. The player who has the most boxes wins the game!

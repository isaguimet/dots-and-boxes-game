        <h1>Welcome to the Dots and Boxes game!</h1>
        <p>
          In this game, the objective is to be the player with the most completed boxes by adding
          lines to the board game canvas.
        </p>
        <h2><b>How do you play?</b></h2>
        <p>
          Players take turns to add lines to the board. Each player can add one line of their color to a grey dashed line that connects
          2 adjacent dots. Whenever a player completes a box, the box will be colored to the player's color and count one point towards
          the player's total box count.
        </p>
        <p>
          Players who complete a box, get one extra turn (they get to add another bonus line).
        </p>
        <p>
          The game ends when someone claims the last box. The player who has the most boxes wins the game!
        </p>
        <h2><b>How many players can play?</b></h2>
        <p>
          Exactly 3 players can play at a time. Player 1 is blue, Player 2 is red, and
          Player 3 is green.
        </p>
